Creating 7Z distribution on Windows 8.1
=======================================

Install Qt 6.2.4 with the online installer. Include the latest MinGW11
package under Tools.

Starting from Qt 6.3.0, it WON'T run on Windows 8.1 anymore. Too many
dependencies on Win10 and later. Recompiling from source doesn't help.

Install MSYS and run pacman -S make

Both need to be in your path. Build as if we're on Linix. qmake, make, etc...

frida.exe is in build\release.

Create a new directory called Frida-version-win64
Copy frida.exe to that directory
Inside the directory, run:

windeployqt --no-translations --no-virtualkeyboard --no-webkit2 --compiler-runtime frida.exe

7zip folder to Frida-version-win64.7z

Done.
